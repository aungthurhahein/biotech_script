PEP8 in a brief

#### Code Layout
* 4 spaces for indentation
* For hanging indents,align hirarchily
* Limit line length to 79 chars
* 2 blank lines for class and 1 for method
* Use blank line as logical seperator within methods

#### Strings Quote
* Single or double quote? it doesn't matter
* Be consistent and stick to it

#### White Spaces
* whitespace afre comma,semicolon and colon. Not BEFORE!!
* use one space each for assigment(a = b). No to (a= b), (a =b), (a=   b),(a   =b)
* Can use whitespaces as logical seperator (3*2 - 4),(4*3 + 7*8)
* No space for default parameter assignment. def hello(name,msg="Hello")
* One statement per line

#### Comments
* blockcomment for all the code followed after
* inline comments should express logical statements
* Document string starts and ends with three double quoted chars

#### Naming things
* CapWord convention for class (DoTheseThings)
* lowercase for functions (def do_this():)
* function parameters (def do_this(param_one,param_two):)
