### Bioinformatics scripts
These are the scripts to deal with various bioinformatics RNA Seq assembly tasks such as manipulating assembly outputs,clusterting outputs and up/downstream analysis of sequences.
BioPython package is necessary to install to run some scripts.

The purpose of the scripts can be seen at each file docstring with brief usage.

It's mostly for personal usage and so,there is a highly chance that some scripts are messy and impossible to reproduce.
